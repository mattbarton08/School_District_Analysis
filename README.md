# School District Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis:
In this analysis, I looked at the math and reading scores of all students in the district and looked at which factors might have contributed to high or low passing rates. The ninth grade scores for both math and reading had to be dropped due to academic dishonesty which changed the story the data tells.

## Results:

Changing these grades did not greatly affect the district math or reading scores or passing percentages. When rounded to the nearest percent, the percent of students who passed math, reading, and overall was the same.
